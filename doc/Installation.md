# Installation

Refer the Apache Arrow [page](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/install.html#system-compatibility) for system compatibility.

The [build](../build/) folder contains a shell script which creates a virtual Python environment that installs pyarrow and any other supporting packages.

1. Navigate to the build directory
2. Run the build program.

```
./build.sh
```

3. Use lines 16 & 18 of [build.sh](../build/build.sh#16) to test / deactivate / remove the virtual environment when not needed.
